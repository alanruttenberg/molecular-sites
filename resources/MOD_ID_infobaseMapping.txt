# The follow is a list of MOD IDs taken from the PSI-MOD ontology, which correspond to the
# modifications seen in the Histone Infobase and TDR data sets. 
# MOD:XXXXX is the PSI-MOD id, followed by the term name, followed by the abbreviation
# used in the Infobase. If no abbreviation is listed, that modification is not found in
# the Infobase data set, and thus no abbreviation exists. 
# Note: An abbreviation preceded by "potentially" means that MOD id is assumed to 
# represent the same type of modification as the abbreviation. Ex. MOD:00076 in the
# TDR, a symmetric dimethyl-L-arginine, probably represents the same modification 
# 'me2' (dimethylation) on an arginine, in the Infobase, but may not. A dimethylated 
# arginine (MOD:00783) maybe be asymmetric (MOD:00077) or symmetric (MOD:00076) but
# we cannot tell which in the Infobase data the abbreviation 'me2' refers to, only
# that 'R-me2'is a dimethylated arginine .

MOD:00046 : O-phospho-L-serine : ph
MOD:00047 : O-phospho-L-threonine : ph
MOD:00064 : N6-acetyl-L-lysine : ac
MOD:00076 : symmetric dimethyl-L-arginine : potentially me2
MOD:00048 : O4'-phospho-L-tyrosine : ph
MOD:00083 : N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine : me3
MOD:00084 : N6,N6-dimethyl-L-lysine : me2
MOD:00085 : N6-methyl-L-lysine : me1
MOD:00059 : N-acetyl-L-proline : 
MOD:00058 : N-acetyl-L-methionine
MOD:00078 : omega-N-methyl-L-arginine : potentially me1
MOD:00060 : N-acetyl-L-serine :

MOD:00219 : L-citrulline : ci
MOD:00126 : N6-biotinyl-L-lysine : bio
MOD:01148 : ubiquitinylated lysine : ub

For lysine ribosylation I found MOD:00731 : ribosylated and
                                MOD:01399 : N6-(ADP-ribosyl)-L-lysine : ar

I think the latter is the better one
